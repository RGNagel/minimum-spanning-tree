* minimum spanning tree algorithm implementation
  
  - For more details in the algorithm and its implementation, check presentation in =./presentation=

  - To input a graph, use a file like =grafo_input.csv=, where each line is a
    edge: source and destiny vertices plus edge weight.
 
  - Use =make= to run program:
    
    - =make all_steps=

      goes through all steps to output a image containing both graphs (input and
      output of MST), and clean intermediary files afterwards

    - =make=

      compile the program and then you can execute it manually by =./program.out=
